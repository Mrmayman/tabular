[![Made with iced](https://iced.rs/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)

(** Now ported to Iced v0.13.1 by [Mrmayman](https://github.com/Mrmayman) **)

A table widget for `iced` which is generic over the data type in cells and cell references. Create spreadsheet-like interfaces with ease!

*Results may vary. No pivots included. Side effects may include sorting headaches, cell formatting debates, and the occasional formula that looks right but isn't. Creating a formula engine is left as an exercise for the obsessed reader - this table is just a table!*
